# AgenticQA - Lightweight Test Management MVP

A modern, lightweight test management system that leverages browser local storage for all data persistence and integrates with Playwright MCP for automated test execution.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Test Pack Management** - Create, categorize, and manage test prompts
- **Automated Test Execution** - Direct integration with Playwright MCP via bridge server
- **Manual Execution Fallback** - Execute tests manually through Cursor IDE when bridge is not available
- **Local Storage** - No backend required, all data stored in browser
- **Visual Reports** - Charts and analytics for test execution results
- **Bug Tracking** - Link bugs to failed test executions
- **Data Import/Export** - Backup and restore your test data

### Bridge Server Architecture
The bridge server acts as an intermediary between AgenticQA (web app) and Playwright MCP:
- Accepts HTTP requests from AgenticQA
- Translates them to MCP protocol commands
- Communicates with Playwright MCP server via STDIO
- Returns results back to AgenticQA in JSON format

### Test Categories
- Functional
- Regression  
- System Integration
- Smoke Test
- Performance

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Start the Playwright MCP Bridge Server
The bridge server enables direct communication between AgenticQA and Playwright MCP.

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click start-bridge.bat
# OR run in command prompt:
npm install
node playwright-mcp-bridge.js
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
npm install
node playwright-mcp-bridge.js
```

The MCP status indicator in the header will show "MCP Connected" when the bridge server is running.

### Alternative: Manual Execution via Cursor IDE
If you prefer not to use the bridge server, you can still execute tests manually through Cursor IDE:

1. Install Playwright MCP in Cursor (Settings ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí Add Server)
2. Configure it with:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Open AgenticQA
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No additional installation required!

### 3. Create Test Packs
Navigate to "Test Packs" and create your test prompts with:
- Test name
- Test type/category
- Feature/module
- Test instructions (natural language prompt)
- Expected results

### 4. Execute Tests
When you click "Execute" on a test:

**If Bridge Server is Running (Automated):**
- AgenticQA automatically executes the test via the bridge server
- Browser actions are performed by Playwright MCP
- Screenshots are captured automatically
- Results are displayed immediately in AgenticQA

**If Bridge Server is Not Running (Manual):**
1. A modal appears with the test prompt
2. Copy the prompt to your clipboard
3. Paste it into Cursor IDE (with Playwright MCP enabled)
4. Cursor will execute the test using Playwright MCP
5. Copy the results from Cursor
6. Paste them back into AgenticQA
7. Results are parsed and stored automatically

### 5. View Reports
The Reports section provides:
- Test execution statistics
- Pass/fail rate trends
- Execution history with filtering
- Detailed execution results with screenshots

### 6. Track Bugs
- Log bugs for failed tests
- Track bug severity and status
- Link bugs to specific test executions

## üìã Test Prompt Format

### Writing Test Prompts
Write your test steps in natural language. The system will parse and execute them automatically when MCP is connected.

**Example Test Prompt:**
```
Navigate to https://example.com
Click on "Login" button
Type "user@example.com" in "Email" field
Type "password123" in "Password" field
Click "Submit"
Wait for 2 seconds
Verify "Dashboard" text is visible
```

### Supported Actions:
- **Navigate**: `Navigate to [URL]`, `Go to [URL]`, `Open [URL]`
- **Click**: `Click on "[element]"`, `Click the "[element]" button`
- **Type**: `Type "[text]" in "[field]"`, `Enter "[text]" into "[field]"`
- **Wait**: `Wait for [X] seconds`, `Wait [X]`
- **Verify**: `Verify "[text]" is visible`, `Check that "[element]" exists`

### Automated Execution via Playwright MCP
When MCP is connected, AgenticQA:
1. Parses your natural language test steps
2. Converts them to Playwright MCP commands
3. Executes them in a real browser
4. Captures screenshots
5. Returns detailed results

### Manual Execution Format
When executing manually through Cursor IDE, the app expects results in JSON format:
```json
{
  "status": "passed",
  "duration": 5200,
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "Navigate to homepage",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 1200,
      "screenshot": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    }
  ],
  "logs": ["Test started", "All assertions passed"]
}
```

Or simple text responses like:
- "Test passed"
- "Test failed: Element not found"
- "Test blocked: Environment issue"

## üõ† Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RowenGopi87/AgenticQA.git
