# AgenticQA - Lightweight Test Management MVP

A modern, lightweight test management system that leverages browser local storage for all data persistence and integrates with Playwright MCP for automated test execution.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Test Pack Management** - Create, categorize, and manage test prompts
- **Automated Test Execution** - Direct integration with Playwright MCP server for automated browser testing
- **Manual Execution Fallback** - Execute tests manually through Cursor IDE when MCP is not available
- **Local Storage** - No backend required, all data stored in browser
- **Visual Reports** - Charts and analytics for test execution results
- **Bug Tracking** - Link bugs to failed test executions
- **Data Import/Export** - Backup and restore your test data

### Test Categories
- Functional
- Regression  
- System Integration
- Smoke Test
- Performance

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Start Playwright MCP Server (Optional but Recommended)
For automated test execution, start the Playwright MCP server:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Double-click start-playwright-mcp.bat
# OR run in command prompt:
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8998
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --port 8998
```

The MCP status indicator in the header will show "MCP Connected" when the server is running.

### 2. Open AgenticQA
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No additional installation required!

### 3. Create Test Packs
Navigate to "Test Packs" and create your test prompts with:
- Test name
- Test type/category
- Feature/module
- Test instructions (natural language prompt)
- Expected results

### 4. Execute Tests
When you click "Execute" on a test:

**If MCP is Connected (Automated):**
- AgenticQA automatically executes the test via Playwright MCP
- Browser actions are performed automatically
- Screenshots are captured
- Results are displayed immediately

**If MCP is Offline (Manual):**
- A modal appears with test instructions
- Copy the prompt to Cursor IDE
- Execute manually and paste results back
- Results are parsed and stored

### 5. View Reports
The Reports section provides:
- Test execution statistics
- Pass/fail rate trends
- Execution history with filtering
- Detailed execution results with screenshots

### 6. Track Bugs
- Log bugs for failed tests
- Track bug severity and status
- Link bugs to specific test executions

## üìã Test Prompt Format

### Writing Test Prompts
Write your test steps in natural language. The system will parse and execute them automatically when MCP is connected.

**Example Test Prompt:**
```
Navigate to https://example.com
Click on "Login" button
Type "user@example.com" in "Email" field
Type "password123" in "Password" field
Click "Submit"
Wait for 2 seconds
Verify "Dashboard" text is visible
```

### Supported Actions:
- **Navigate**: `Navigate to [URL]`, `Go to [URL]`, `Open [URL]`
- **Click**: `Click on "[element]"`, `Click the "[element]" button`
- **Type**: `Type "[text]" in "[field]"`, `Enter "[text]" into "[field]"`
- **Wait**: `Wait for [X] seconds`, `Wait [X]`
- **Verify**: `Verify "[text]" is visible`, `Check that "[element]" exists`

### Automated Execution via Playwright MCP
When MCP is connected, AgenticQA:
1. Parses your natural language test steps
2. Converts them to Playwright MCP commands
3. Executes them in a real browser
4. Captures screenshots
5. Returns detailed results

### Manual Execution Format
When executing manually through Cursor IDE, the app expects results in JSON format:
```json
{
  "status": "passed",
  "duration": 5200,
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "Navigate to homepage",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 1200,
      "screenshot": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    }
  ],
  "logs": ["Test started", "All assertions passed"]
}
```

Or simple text responses like:
- "Test passed"
- "Test failed: Element not found"
- "Test blocked: Environment issue"

## üõ† Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RowenGopi87/AgenticQA.git
   cd AgenticQA
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

3. Start creating and executing tests!

## üíæ Data Management

### Local Storage
All data is stored in browser localStorage under these keys:
- `agenticqa_tests` - Test definitions
- `agenticqa_executions` - Execution history
- `agenticqa_bugs` - Bug reports

### Export/Import
- Click "Export" to download all your data as JSON
- Click "Import" to restore data from a previous export
