# AgenticQA - Lightweight Test Management MVP

A modern, lightweight test management system that leverages browser local storage for all data persistence and integrates with Cursor IDE's Playwright MCP for test execution.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Test Pack Management** - Create, categorize, and manage test prompts
- **Manual MCP Integration** - Execute tests through Cursor IDE with Playwright MCP
- **Local Storage** - No backend required, all data stored in browser
- **Visual Reports** - Charts and analytics for test execution results
- **Bug Tracking** - Link bugs to failed test executions
- **Data Import/Export** - Backup and restore your test data

### Test Categories
- Functional
- Regression  
- System Integration
- Smoke Test
- Performance

## üéØ Using with Cursor IDE & Playwright MCP

AgenticQA integrates seamlessly with Cursor IDE's Playwright MCP for automated test execution:

### Quick Setup
1. **Install Playwright MCP**: `npm install -g @playwright/mcp@latest`
2. **Configure Cursor**: Add Playwright MCP in Cursor Settings ‚Üí Features ‚Üí MCP Servers
3. **Execute Tests**: Copy prompts from AgenticQA and run them in Cursor Chat

### Workflow
1. Create tests in AgenticQA with natural language instructions
2. Click "Execute" to get a formatted prompt for Cursor
3. Paste the prompt in Cursor IDE chat (Cmd/Ctrl + I)
4. Cursor uses Playwright MCP tools to execute the test automatically
5. Copy the JSON results back to AgenticQA for storage and reporting

### Example Test Execution
```
Test: Login Functionality
Instructions: 
1. Navigate to https://demo.opencart.com/admin/
2. Enter "demo" in username field
3. Enter "demo" in password field  
4. Click Login button
5. Verify dashboard loads

Result: Cursor automatically executes using browser_navigate, browser_type, browser_click, and browser_snapshot tools
```

For detailed setup instructions, see `docs/cursor-quickstart.md`

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Open AgenticQA
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser. No installation or server setup required!

### 2. Create Test Packs
Navigate to "Test Packs" and create your test prompts with:
- Test name
- Test type/category
- Feature/module
- Test instructions (natural language prompt)
- Expected results

### 3. Execute Tests via Cursor IDE
When you click "Execute" on a test:
1. AgenticQA generates a formatted test prompt
2. Copy the prompt to your clipboard
3. Paste it into Cursor IDE with Playwright MCP enabled
4. Execute the test in Cursor
5. Copy the results back to AgenticQA
6. The app will parse and store the results automatically

### 4. View Reports
The Reports section provides:
- Test execution statistics
- Pass/fail rate trends
- Execution history with filtering
- Detailed execution results with screenshots (if provided by MCP)

### 5. Track Bugs
- Log bugs for failed tests
- Track bug severity and status
- Link bugs to specific test executions

## üìã Test Execution Format

### Input Prompt to Cursor IDE
The app generates prompts in this format:
```
Execute the following test using Playwright:

Test Name: [Test Name]
Module: [Module Name]
Type: [Test Type]

Test Steps:
[Your test steps in natural language]

Expected Results:
[Expected outcomes]

Please execute this test and return the results in JSON format including:
- Overall status (passed/failed/blocked)
- Execution duration
- Step-by-step results with screenshots if applicable
- Any error logs or messages
- Validation of expected results
```

### Expected Response Format
The app can parse JSON responses like:
```json
{
  "status": "passed",
  "duration": 5200,
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "Navigate to homepage",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 1200,
      "screenshot": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    }
  ],
  "logs": ["Test started", "All assertions passed"],
  "validationResults": {
    "passed": true,
    "details": "All expected results matched"
  }
}
```

Or simple text responses like:
- "Test passed"
- "Test failed: Element not found"
- "Test blocked: Environment issue"

## üõ† Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RowenGopi87/AgenticQA.git
