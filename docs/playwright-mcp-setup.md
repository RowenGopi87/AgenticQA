   Type: [Test Type]
   
   Test Steps:
   [Your test steps in natural language]
   
   Expected Results:

   ```

3. **Execute in Cursor**

## MCP Response Format

The MCP server returns results in this format:

```json
{
  "status": "passed",
  "duration": 5234,
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "Navigate to login page",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 1200,
      "screenshot": "data:image/png;base64,..."
    },
    {
      "action": "Enter credentials",
      "status": "passed",
      "duration": 500
    }
  ],
  "logs": [
    "Test started at 2024-01-15 10:30:00",
    "Navigation successful",
    "Login completed"
  ],
  "validationResults": {
    "passed": true,
    "details": "All assertions passed"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Detected
- Ensure the server is running on port 3000
- Check firewall settings
- Try accessing http://localhost:3000/status in your browser

### CORS Issues
- Start the MCP server with `--cors` flag
- Use a browser extension to disable CORS for localhost (development only)

### Test Execution Fails
- Check the browser console for errors
- Ensure test steps are clear and specific
- Verify selectors and URLs are correct

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom MCP Server URL
```javascript
// In your browser console or add to app.js
window.AgenticQAMCP.init({
  mcpServerUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',
  timeout: 120000 // 2 minutes
});
```

### Headless Mode
Configure in the test prompt:
```
Options:
- Run in headless mode
- Capture screenshots for each step
- Set timeout to 30 seconds
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Local Only**: MCP server should only be accessible from localhost
2. **Authentication**: Consider adding authentication to the MCP server
3. **Input Validation**: Validate test prompts before execution
4. **Sandboxing**: Run tests in isolated browser contexts
